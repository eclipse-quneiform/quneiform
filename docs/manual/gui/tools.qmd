# Tools {#sec-gui-tools}

A selection of tools are available for examining and converting text from the **Tools** section of the ribbon.

## String Info

The **String Info** dialog provides information about a string.
This includes information such as string length and which (if any) extended ASCII characters it contains.

## Convert String

The **Convert String** dialog provides the ability to convert portions of a string to different character sets.
As an example, this can be useful for translating Latin-1 (i.e, 7-bit ASCII) into Japanese (i.e., full-width) numbers.

If text is selected in the editor, then that will be used as the initial source string when opening these dialogs.
